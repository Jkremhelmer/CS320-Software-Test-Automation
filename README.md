How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  There are many ways in order to make sure your code, program, or software is functional and secure. There are many different formas of testing that can be accomplished as well as peer reviews. It is very important to ensure that you are testing correctly as well. If a test does fail, you need to be able to review why it failed, correct the failure and retest. It may be tedious, but in the end doing it correctly will ensure the best possible product. 

  How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?  
    One way to interpret the user needs is through surveys. Ask questions, observe actions, and follow up with improvements. Getting the requirements correct is also very important in getting to the correct end product.

  How do I approach designing software?
    I approach designing software with an open mind. I want to know what makes you tick and what you really want out of the software I am designing for you. I like to approach with no preconcieved notions of what something must be.
